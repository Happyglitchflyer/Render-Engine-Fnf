How to run this:
You need pygame,tkinker, and the other modules in the code.
You need to have python or something that runs python AND pygame(VScode)
What to do:
Just put in a json, inst(.ogg) or both inst and voices(.mp3), and if there are voices, you should just put in the name of the song and answer yes to the voices part.
If you have a .re file, just put in the amount of total notes in a chart.(Unneccesary)
Problems to try to fix:
It does run at 5 fps if there are more than 100000 notes.
